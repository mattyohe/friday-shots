Friday Shots
=============

Rules
-----
1. The competition begins every Friday promptly at beer thirty (once at least one person has opened a beer and it is 4:30pm or later).
2. Anyone in the office at the time of the competition can participate.
3. No practice shots can be taken once the competition begins.
4. Each participant gets to take one shot after paying the $1 entry fee. All fees must be paid  
   prior to the first shot.
5. All shooters who hit the bell will split the pot.


Bell Strikage Success Criteria
------------------------------
1. The participant must have both of his or her feet on the ground, behind the
   gap between Tes and Matt Hewes' desks.
2. The participant must use the original blue nerf pistol. It is especially noted
   Derek may not use his own nerf gun.
3. The dart must strike either the bell's rope or its body, but importantly not
   the piece of metal attached to the wall or the arm connecting the bell to
   said piece of metal.
4. Only bank shots off the back wall (the wall the bell is attached to) count as
   a hit unless the shooter calls "bank". If the shooter calls bank then non-
   bank shots don't count. Hitting anything other than the back wall disqualifies
   the shot.
